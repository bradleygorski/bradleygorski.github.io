          <h2>Exit from the Slaughterhouse of Literature</h2>

      There is, according to Franco Moretti, a terrifying place where literature goes to die.  The doors of print houses, book stores, personal and public libraries all open directly onto the Slaughterhouse. Books by the hundreds, by the thousands, flow like unsuspecting sheep into the pulpy abattoir of our very selective collective memory. Virtually every book is killed. Characters are pulped. Authors meet their end. Very few manage to slip through this dark and messy business to the light beyond, to further print runs, to new translations, to college syllabi, “classic” status, a place in the canon. But of course, some do. So there must be an exit somewhere. The trouble is, it’s not marked. It’s not clearly designated how to get there from here, how to skirt all the mechanisms working against the author, her characters, and creations and find a way out.
</p>
<p>
Moretti tries to trace the way out of the slaughterhouse by following Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s footprints towards the exit. What was it about Sherlock Holmes, or perhaps about the structure of the stories, or about how the mysteries unravel that made people keep coming back to Conan Doyle while they left behind other stories published in the same popular British weekly (The Strand) in the same decade? Moretti decides on clues. Clues—a new device in fiction at the time and a not-very-old one in real-life criminal investigation—resonated with a certain scientistic mindset prevalent in the late nineteenth century. Recent technological advances had seemed to render everything decipherable, analyzable, subject to human reason. Readers wanted to participate in that trend. They wanted legibility and logic: a story that showed how and why things happened, not just what happened.
</p><p>
And this is what Conan Doyle provided. Dr. Watson carefully takes us through every clue that we as readers would need to solve the case. We see everything he sees, and everything Sherlock sees (in most of the stories). So when Sherlock finally cracks the case and explains to a reliably astounded Watson how he reached his conclusions, all of the signposts are familiar to us, everything falls into place, and the world makes sense.
</p><p>
But Moretti gets tripped up at this point in his argument. Conan Doyle, it seems, was not the only author at the time to use clues, nor was he the most systematic or consistent practitioner of the device. On top of that, Conan Doyle’s clues are often completely indecipherable. Readers need to wait for Holmes’s explanation before making any sense of them.
</p><p>
So if we’re looking for a way out of the Slaughterhouse, Moretti leaves us with a pretty confusing map. Use clues, but inconsistently. Or more broadly: figure out some device that resonates with readers of time, but don’t worry about deploying it in any systematic way; in fact, maybe it’s better if it’s out of the readers’ understanding, almost mystically unavailable.
</p><p>
I’m going to propose something different. Or rather a modification of the Moretti model borrowing a couple of terms from Stephen Greenblatt. These are “resonance” and “wonder.” Here’s how Greenblatt defines the two terms in relation to constructing museum displays (his topic at the time):
</p><p class="blockquote">
By resonance I mean the power of the displayed object to reach out beyond its formal boundaries to a larger world, to evoke in the viewer the complex, dynamic cultural forces from which it has emerged and for which it may be taken by a viewer to stand. By wonder I mean the power of the displayed object to stop the viewer in his or her tracks, to convey an arresting sense of uniqueness, to evoke an exalted attention.
</p><p>
Conan Doyle’s clues certainly reach out to a larger world, towards those “dynamic cultural forces” of his time. But this is only part of the map. Without wonder, he’d still be stuck in the slaughterhouse, doomed to a fate no better than Alice Williamson’s “Robbery at Foxborough” (1894). Wonder—and here I’ll redefine Greenblatt’s term a bit for the literary context—has to do with the aesthetic effect of the text, how its style, form, and content work together to produce in the reader that feeling of aesthetic absorption, satisfaction, and further engagement (rereading, reading something similar, recommending to friends, etc.). In other words, while resonance is an intellectual connection to a broader context, wonder is the aesthetic effect generated by the text, and probably, it seems to me, intended by the author. In fact, it looks like Conan Doyle intended something close to wonder when pure chance brought him to clues. In Moretti’s account:
</p><p class="blockquote">
Doyle stumbled upon clues while he was working at something completely different, which was the myth of Sherlock Holmes. Think of the opening scenes of the Adventures, when Holmes “reads” a whole life from the signs on the body of his client; this is what Conan Doyle wants from clues: a support for Holmes’s omniscience. (215)
</p><p>
But Holmes’s superhuman omniscience is not incidental to Conan Doyle’s success. It’s central to it. The near-mystical mental acuity of Holmes makes him (and the stories about him) into a source of fascination. In Greenblatt’s terms, the Holmes character (and not the clues or the structure of the stories) produces an “arresting sense of uniqueness, evokes an exalted attention.” This is crucial to Conan Doyle’s success. Without the Holmes character Conan Doyle might never have found his way to clues. But much more important: without Holmes readers would never have found their way to Conan Doyle.
</p><p>
If Watson teaches us anything, it’s that clues alone aren’t enough. You need a charismatic, radiant brilliance to make something out them. Holmes—the awe-inspiring, fascinating creation—stands at the very beginning of any map out of the Slaughterhouse. He’s the one who enchants our attention, points us towards the exit, and helps us follow the clues to get there.
