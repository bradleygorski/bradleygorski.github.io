        </p>
        <br />
        <p> The <a href="bestsellers-of-moscow.html">first post in this series</a> discussed
          one of the clearest tendencies that emerges from Russia’s first bestseller lists, the
          movement from translated to homegrown Russian bestsellers. The top ten bestsellers over
          the first year of the lists’ existence, for instance, include only one Russian, while
          that proportion has entirely flipped by the end of the lists in 1999:</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">

            <figcaption align="center">The top ten bestselling authors in 1993 (left) and over the

              </figure>
              </div>

        <p>A more granular look at the data—at the level of titles instead of authors—shows a slightly
          less stark, but no less clear trajectory. At the beginning of the lists, translated titles
          vie with homegrown offerings for primacy, but as the lists continue, Russian titles clearly
          win out, claiming around 70% of the bestselling spots over the lists’ last years.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <figure>

            <img class="img-proj" src="../images/7.1proptrans.svg" width="100%" alt=""></a>
            <figcaption align="center">The proportion of bestsellers appearing on the <i>Knizhnoe obozrenie</i>

              </figure>
              </div>

        <p>Russian authors’ increasing share of bestseller real-estate can be attributed to a number of
          genre innovations, alongside shifting genre preferences among the reading public. The first
          genre to dominate the lists was romance, but it was soon overtaken by darker genres, first the
          action thriller known as the <em>boevik</em>, and then by the murder mystery known as the <em>detektiv</em>.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <figure>

            <img class="img-proj" src="../images/7.3popgen.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></a>
            <figcaption align="center">The popularity of various genres according to appearances on the

              </figure>
              </div>

          <p>Visualizing this same data slightly differently, we can see the relative market share that each
          of these genres represented throughout the decade. At its peak in early 1998, the <em>detektiv</em>
          accounted for nearly 60% of all bestsellers.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <figure>

            <img class="img-proj" src="../images/7.4percentbygenre.svg" width="100%" alt=""></a>
            <figcaption align="center">The market share of various genres by percentage of appearances on the

              </figure>
              </div>

        <p>These two later genres are both innovations that grew out of the Russian book market. The
          <em>boevik</em> offered testosterone-soaked dreams of vigilante justice that answered the
          chaos of the post-Soviet world with the moral and physical strength of the extraordinary
          individual. This genre brought authors like Daniil Koretskii and Viktor Dotsenko to the top
          of the lists in 1995. It was the first Russian innovation on Western imports, recasting
          hyper-masculine elements of Rambo against a post-Soviet backdrop of social decay, and leading
          to some of the worst cover art of the decade.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <div class="col-lg-6">

            <figcaption align="center">Covers of Viktor Dotsenko's <em>Mad Dog's Gold</em> (left)

              </figure>
              </div>

        <p>By 1996, another genre arrived that would dominate the rest of the decade: the
          <em>zhenskii detektiv</em>. These detective novels whose author, protagonist, and intended
          audience were all women answered the success of the action thriller by bucking retrograde
          gender norms to show women outsmarting (and not just out-muscling) the mire of chaos capitalism.
          They seemed to combine the appeal of both romance and <em>boevik</em> genres to create a
          female-centric narrative structure that could plausibly take place in post-Soviet reality.</p>

        <p>It was largely thanks to these genres (or more precisely, these genre innovations) that Russian
          authors overtook their international colleagues on the <em>Knizhnoe obozrenie</em> bestseller
          lists. If the beginning of the decade saw romance dominate the list, soon the action thriller
          (or <em>boevik</em>) takes over, and then the <em>detektiv</em>.</p>

        <p>Part of this market success can be explained by the innovations local authors were able to infuse
          into the genre as it was imported. If we disaggregate the market share data by genre, we can see that
          over the decade, Russophone authors came to dominate the <em>boevik</em> and the <em>detektiv</em>.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-proj" src="../images/7.5a-boevik.svg" width="100%" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-proj" src="../images/7.5b-detektiv.svg" width="100%" alt=""></a>

            <figcaption align="center">Proportion of titles appearing on the <em>Knizhnoe obozrenie</em> fiction

              </figure>
              </div>

        <p>But the romance, the most popular genre at the beginning of the decade, was never successfully adapted
          by Russophone authors. It remained an imported genre, set in exotic locations, and unable to speak to
          post-Soviet reality. And it fell off bestseller lists by decade’s end.</p>

<figcaption align="center">Proportion of romance titles appearing on the <em>Knizhnoe obozrenie</em> fiction

    </figure>
    </div>

        <p>By the end of the decade only one foreigner remained on the bestseller list, and it wasn’t a huge
          international name such as Stephen King or Danielle Steel (both of whom had enjoyed early 1990s
          popularity), but a Polish writer who has never been translated into English named Joanna Chmielewska.
          Her bestselling works had more in common with the post-Soviet <em>zhenskii detektiv</em> than with
          any of the Western genres imported at the beginning of the decade. Works that somehow spoke to
          postsocialist realities, it seems, had the best chance of making the list in post-Soviet Russia.</p>

        <p>
          What we see, then, over the course of this decade is perhaps not what you would expect. It is not the
          increasing integration of Western and Russian markets of culture, moving towards convergence in something
          like world literary culture. Instead, it is an initial fascination with imported culture followed by a gradual
          divergence, a process of imitation, adoption, and innovation that actually makes Western pulp fiction
          into something different. The reason for this is at least in part because post-Soviet Russia was not
          like the West. Despite the market economy and putative democracy (or perhaps because of the patent
          failures of these western imports) Russia was not the “normal country” that so many had hoped for,
          but something different. And that difference was reflected in its transformations of genre forms.</p></br>
